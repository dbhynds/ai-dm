# Fix the following mechanics

## The DM shouldn't tell the character information that they can't observe. Example:

```
Okay, Professor Morgan Hawthorne, a level 20 Mountain Dwarf Druid of the Circle of Spores! This is going to be fun.

Here's an encounter for you:

Encounter: You are traveling through a dense, ancient forest, the air thick with the scent of decaying leaves and rich soil. The path ahead is overgrown, and as you round a bend, you notice a clearing. In the center of the clearing, a massive, gnarled oak tree pulses with an unnatural, sickly green light. Surrounding the tree are several figures:

3 Blights: Animated, corrupted plant creatures, their eyes glowing with malevolent intent.
1 Druid (Corrupted): A former protector of the forest, now twisted by dark magic. They are clad in decaying leaves and vines, their eyes mirroring the sickly green glow of the oak. This corrupted druid is the source of the corruption.
The corrupted druid is chanting in a guttural tongue, and the blights seem to be drawing power from the oak. The forest around them is slowly withering.

The Corrupted Druid: This druid has similar stats to a regular druid but has the following changes.

Has the ability to cast Blight as a bonus action.
Advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened.
```

The player might intuit the following facts, but wouldn't know them for sure. The DM shouldn't tell the player this information:
- This corrupted druid is the source of the corruption.
- The Corrupted Druid: This druid has similar stats to a regular druid but has the following changes.
    - Has the ability to cast Blight as a bonus action.
    - Advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened.

## An agent should roll on behalf of monsters/NPCs that it's running.

```
Alright, you proceed with casting Feeblemind. The corrupted druid, distracted by their ritual, is caught off guard as you emerge from the shadows and unleash the spell.

Did the corrupted druid fail their intelligence saving throw?
```

## An agent should create imaginary stat blocks for characters when combat starts

```
Did the corrupted druid fail their intelligence saving throw?

> What is their intelligence modifier?

That's a good question. I don't have the exact stats for the corrupted druid, so let's assume they have a typical druid's intelligence. I'll set their Intelligence to 12 (+1). They need to roll a 18 or higher to succeed.

Did the corrupted druid fail their intelligence saving throw?
```

## An agent should run combat when in combat

```
What do you do next?

Whose turn is it? What is the initiative order?

Okay, good question. Here is the initiative order:

Professor Morgan Hawthorne: (You)
Blight 1: (Took 20 damage)
Blight 2:
Blight 3:
It is now Blight 1's turn. It will attack you. It has a +3 to hit and does 1d6+1 damage. What is your AC?
```

```
The Blight got a 9, so it misses you.

What do Blight 2 and Blight 3 do?

> You're the DM. You tell me

Okay, Blight 2 and Blight 3 will both move to engage you in melee combat, and attack. Here are the results:

Blight 2: Attacks, rolls a 12 to hit.
Blight 3: Attacks, rolls a 6 to hit.
Do either of those hit you?
```

## An agent should remember the characters, their abilities, etc.

```
What is your AC?

look on my character sheet

You are right! Your AC is 21.
```

## Don't give ridiculous loot

```
Okay, you approach the withered remains of the corrupted druid. The body is mostly dust and decaying plant matter, but a few items remain intact:

A Staff of Withering: This staff is made from twisted, blackened wood.
A Pouch of Emeralds: This small leather pouch contains five emeralds, each worth 100 gp.
A Withered Amulet: This amulet is carved from bone and inlaid with slivers of obsidian.
Do you want to examine any of these items more closely or attempt to identify them?
```
